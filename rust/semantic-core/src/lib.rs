//! # semantic-core — shared semantic extraction base
//!
//! The single home for the semantic algorithms that every extractor shares.
//! Rust's mission: analyse a script in full and return every editorial and
//! visual *candidate* with identity, evidence and priority consistent.
//! PipelineGen selects and orchestrates; Chronon renders. This crate never
//! touches FFmpeg, GPU, compositing or RenderingGen — it is pure text
//! analysis with deterministic, source-grounded output.
//!
//! Layering (no cycles):
//!
//! ```text
//! semantic-core   (this crate: numbers, dates, identity, relations, manifest)
//!   ├── visualner         (entity tokenizer)   -> re-exports dates/numbers
//!   ├── pipelinegen-muscles (phrase/scene)     -> re-exports dates/numbers
//!   └── semantic-engine   (the NDJSON worker)  -> builds the manifest
//! ```
//!
//! Unification here means ONE numeric parser, ONE date normalizer, ONE
//! identity registry and ONE relation vocabulary — not one giant file. Each
//! collector keeps its tokenizer-specific span detection; the parse and the
//! typed projection live here so two paths can never disagree about a value.
