//! `semantic_manifest.v2` — the single typed contract returned by the Rust
//! semantic engine.
//!
//! The manifest is the ONE source of truth PipelineGen reads. Per the contract
//! every candidate carries UTF-8 byte offsets, verbatim evidence, a canonical
//! id, a score and provenance (which analyzer produced it). The engine keeps
//! every valid candidate; the Go planner selects what to visualize. Nothing is
//! invented to fill an empty category: an extractor that finds nothing emits
//! zero results.
