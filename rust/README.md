# PipelineGen Rust components

This directory is the isolated Rust boundary for native execution
components (the “muscles”). The Go application remains the composition root
and owns canonical state, application decisions, jobs, and the transactional
outbox.

## Boundary

Rust components must communicate through explicit typed contracts. They must
not directly open PipelineGen SQLite databases, publish to Google Drive, write
Qdrant state, or load credentials. Those responsibilities remain behind the
existing Go application and infrastructure ports until a separate migration
contract is approved.

The workspace now has two deliberately separate execution boundaries:

- `semantic-engine` is the dedicated CPU-only text-analysis worker. One
  `analyze_script` request carries all scenes and returns the versioned
  `semantic_manifest.v2`; it does not search for assets or perform media I/O.
- `pipelinegen-muscles` remains the media executor and hosts the existing
  Phrase Impact and Scene Intelligence workers during their migration. It
  owns FFmpeg-related operations and must not become the semantic engine's
  dependency.

`semantic-core` owns shared semantic contracts and deterministic primitives
(grounding, sentence spans, numeric/date facts, identity and relation types).
`visualner` remains the extraction library, while `mediasampler` and
`ndjson-stdio` remain separate reusable crates. Go sends the complete scene
batch to `bin/semantic-engine`; it verifies the returned source spans and
keeps asset selection, timing and planning in PipelineGen. Chronon owns
rendering.

The manifest preserves candidates and evidence. It does not assert that a
textual claim is externally true, and empty or unsupported categories stay
empty. Editorial top-N and asset availability remain planner decisions.

The current V2 engine emits chronology groups only when multiple normalized
dates occur in sentences with explicit event predicates. It also recognizes
consecutive numbered source lines as enumerations or rankings; a declared Top
10 carries its actual member count and completeness flag. It does not fill
missing ranks. Process, causal, cross-scene groups, entity-linked property
ownership/location facts, and visual search-query generation are not yet part of this engine;
Phrase Impact and Scene Intelligence remain separate during that migration.

## Local check

VisualNER uses the system ICU4C RBNF/CLDR spellout rules. Install the ICU
**development** package (`libicu-dev`, including `pkg-config`) on build hosts;
runtime hosts that execute `bin/visualner` need the matching ICU shared-library
major. The build pins rust_icu's generated symbol names to the installed major
via `RUST_ICU_MAJOR_VERSION_NUMBER`; do not copy that binary to a host with a
different major. The project Dockerfile builds and runs against Bookworm ICU 72.

```sh
ICU_MAJOR=$(pkg-config --modversion icu-i18n | cut -d. -f1)
RUST_ICU_MAJOR_VERSION_NUMBER="$ICU_MAJOR" RUSTUP_TOOLCHAIN=stable rustup run stable cargo test --manifest-path rust/Cargo.toml

# Prints distinct language identifiers with installed ICU spellout rules.
RUST_ICU_MAJOR_VERSION_NUMBER="$ICU_MAJOR" RUSTUP_TOOLCHAIN=stable rustup run stable cargo run --manifest-path rust/Cargo.toml -p visualner -- --locale-count

# Build the executable consumed by the Go adapter.
make build-muscles
```

VisualNER requests must include a BCP-47 `language`. ICU does not provide
spellout rules for every locale and some rule sets are incomplete; missing
locale data fails closed. `--locale-count` reports the installed ICU count,
not a guarantee of equivalent parsing quality in every language.

### Decision: ICU is the single spellout backend

VisualNER's number-word recognition (RBNF/CLDR spellout) is served **only** by
the system ICU4C libraries through `rust_icu_sys` / `rust_icu_uloc` /
`rust_icu_unum`. A pure-Rust rule engine was evaluated and rejected, so the
dependency stays mandatory rather than sitting behind an optional feature:

- The reference RBNF rule sets live in ICU data, not in a Rust crate: ICU4X
  (`icu` 2.x / `icu_segmenter`) does not ship RBNF spellout parsing. A
  pure-Rust path would have to re-implement every locale's rules and would
  silently diverge from the certified behaviour for the supported languages.
- `visualner/src/spellout.rs` depends on ICU-specific semantics
  (`UNUM_PARSE_ALL_INPUT`, resolved-data-locale matching, spellout/ordinal
  styles) that have no equivalent outside ICU4C.
- An optional `spellout` feature would turn a certified capability into a
  build-time switch that silently degrades entity extraction for numbers, so
  the dependency is not feature-gated. `RUST_ICU_MAJOR_VERSION_NUMBER` must
  match the host ICU major or the build fails closed; hosts without
  `libicu-dev` cannot build `visualner` at all instead of producing a binary
  with missing number-word rules.

Revisit only with a concrete pure-Rust RBNF implementation plus a parity
corpus over the supported languages.

## Phrase impact (extractive summary, heavy sentences, bullets)

`pipelinegen-muscles::phrase_impact` is the extractive editorial summary
engine. It never loads models, invokes inference, or touches the media
executor JSON protocol: the caller supplies either one-vector-per-segment
embeddings (the canonical E5 passage vectors) or asks for the deterministic
`lexical_only` fallback, and may pass per-sentence microsecond timings. The
summary and bullets are extractive source sentences, selected separately from
the heavy-sentence ranking, so nothing it returns is a generative,
unsupported paraphrase.

The worker is exposed over the same newline-delimited JSON stdio contract as
the other muscles and is dispatched by binary name (`bin/phrase_impact`) or by
the `phrase-impact` argument. Besides the full analysis request it serves
`{"operation":"split_sentences"}`, the canonical sentence splitter the Go
adapter uses before embedding. The Go side
(`internal/platform/media/rustexec.PhraseImpactAnalyzer`) drives this worker
through the persistent process runner and is wired into the script generation
runner by `wirePhraseImpactAnalyzer`
(`external.rust_phrase_impact_path`, default `bin/phrase_impact`, installed by
`make build-muscles`). A missing or broken worker degrades to "no summary"
rather than failing the run, and the extractive fields are persisted on
`GenerateResult`/`GenerationResult` as `summary`, `bullet_points` and
`heavy_sentences`.

The permanently stored label fixture is explicitly synthetic and cannot be
used as evidence that human Precision@K targets pass. CPU percentage and RSS
are emitted by the benchmark only when measurable via Linux `/proc`; embedding
inference measurements must come from the external caller.

The same analysis emits `chapter_manifest.v1`. The versioned
`segmentation.v1` profile combines semantic and lexical boundary evidence,
optional scene-boundary evidence, editor-configured size constraints, and a
complexity penalty. A global dynamic program selects the partition rather than
making a local threshold decision. Titles rank source-derived keyphrases and
brief topics by chapter overlap and token specificity; bullets remain
contiguous source spans selected using sentence importance and adjacent
semantic coherence. Every chapter and bullet carries sentence-index provenance.
Timestamps are emitted only when aligned sentence timings are supplied. The
profile weights are defaults, not empirically calibrated claims: changing them
requires a separate annotated development/validation set, with a held-out
quality evaluation before claiming segmentation quality.

The chapter regression suite includes behavioral and metamorphic checks for
unrelated topic blocks, repeated and paraphrased topics, scene-boundary
neutrality, gradual transitions, returning topics, grounded conceptual titles,
negation-preserving extractive bullets, duplicate reduction, profile bounds,
cross-language operation, deterministic replay, lexical-only fallback, and
empty/malformed/short inputs. These tests intentionally assert structural and
source-grounding properties rather than fixed title strings. They are not a
replacement for the planned 60/20/20 human-annotated split: no independent
100-script corpus or held-out human title judgments currently ship with this
repository, so WindowDiff, Boundary F1, baseline comparisons, and the proposed
90% title-acceptance target remain unclaimed.

Per-title latency of the production worker (one NDJSON request/response per
titled narration, measured against `bin/phrase_impact`):

```sh
PHRASE_IMPACT_BIN="$PWD/bin/phrase_impact" go test ./scripts/bench \
  -run '^$' -bench BenchmarkPhraseImpactTitles -benchmem
```

The offline Python comparison of extractors over archived scripts stays in
`scripts/bench/phrase_impact.py`.

Run the optimized local benchmark (10 warmups / 100 samples at each requested
word count, concurrency sweep, and 10,000-run memory stress):

```sh
cargo bench --manifest-path rust/Cargo.toml -p pipelinegen-muscles --bench phrase_impact
```

The JSON report defaults to the ignored
`rust/pipelinegen-muscles/.cache/phrase-impact/rust_benchmark.json` (Cargo runs
the benchmark from the package directory); override its path with
`PHRASE_IMPACT_BENCH_OUTPUT`.
