//! Native execution components for PipelineGen.
//!
//! This crate owns capability-scoped media execution for the Rust migration.
//! Components here may perform CPU-heavy or process-level work, but must not
//! become an alternate source of canonical state.
//!
//! Initial boundary rules:
//! - SQLite remains owned by the Go application.
//! - Transactional outbox decisions remain owned by the Go application.
//! - Google Drive and Qdrant access must arrive through explicit contracts.
//! - FFmpeg invocation belongs behind a typed execution interface.
//! - No direct credential or environment-file loading from this crate.
