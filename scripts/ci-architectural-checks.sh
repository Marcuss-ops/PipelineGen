# scripts/ci-architectural-checks.sh — CI gate for the architectural checker.
#
# PR-A (June 2026): adds the `--future-ratchet` flag so the 5 Phase 0 rules
# (interface{}/any growth, setter detector, cross-package type alias,
# fake route, handler-to-DB) run in baseline-on-baseline ratchet mode.
# During the minor cycle (this script's current state) the gate fails ONLY
# on regressions vs scripts/archcheck/phase0_baseline.json; existing
# entries in the baseline are accepted.
#
# Promote-to-required checklist (separate follow-up PR):
#   1. Drop `--future-ratchet` from the command line below.
#   2. Fold runPhase0Checks() into runRatchetChecks() in
#      scripts/archcheck/main.go.
#   3. Update docs/architecture/godlike/14_INITIAL_BACKLOG.md — mark
#      Block 1 + the 5 Phase 0 rules as verified_zero: true.
